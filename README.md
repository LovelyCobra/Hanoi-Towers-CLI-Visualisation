# Towers of Hanoi Puzzle Visualisation in CLI

Just a simple visualisation of how the puzzle called Towers of Hanoi is solved by a classical recursion. I think the code is self-explanatory.
There are 3 versions here. The most simple one in hanoi.py displays only initial and end position of a disc for each move, the second one in main.py in main branch adds showing the upward and downward movements of a disc for each move and the third version in main.py of the Ultimate_visual branch adds the horizontal movement in between rods for each move.
